# üö©What is Custom Password ?

A lot of times while filling forms online we all have come across registration forms that don't allow Google or any other social authentication and prompt the user to add a password to create an account successfully. For that also Google Chrome has a feature of Suggest strong password, but sometimes when you are too dependent on something, then it starts showing its disadvantages. Most users save most of their passwords in their Google Account due to which the Suggest strong password stops coming. To solve that problem I came up with <strong>CustomPassword</strong> built using Node.js which helps you generate a strong password based on your conditions like :

- Length of password
- Composition of password ( whether it should be numeric or alphabetic only or a mix of both or with symbols )

using your own custom made command , we can even copy it to the clipboard and also save it to our local .txt file ü§©
